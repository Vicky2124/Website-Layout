        <div><p style="line-height:1pc;">“I would describe my relationship with my couch as symbiotic –

          (English philosopher)
          “Designing is my hobby. If I didn’t do what I do for a living – 
          at some point when I don’t do this for a living – I’ll probably just do design work.
           I love finding really special pieces of furniture.” – Ellen DeGeneres</p></div>
